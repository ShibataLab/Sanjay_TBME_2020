### Extraction of Nonlinear Synergies for Proportional and Simultaneous Estimation of Finger Kinematics.
          Sanjay Kumar Dwivedi,  Jimson Ngeo and Tomohiro Shibata

This repository contains the source code for the paper accepted to IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering

All the code is in matlab and working fine with matlab 2017

To train the model - run Training_of_the_MRD_model
Change the hyperparameters accordingly.

To analyse the trained model - run MRD_model_analysis
